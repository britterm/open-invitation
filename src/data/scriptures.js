        "Paul says God saved us through the washing of regeneration, so many conclude the Spirit renews people apart from any human cooperation.",
      response:
        "The paragraph celebrates mercy that appeared in the gospel announcement. Immediately afterward Paul urges 'those who have believed God' to devote themselves to good works (3:8); the washing describes the Spirit's cleansing of repentant believers, not a pre-faith event.",
      supports: [
        "The epiphany language echoes 2:11-14, where grace trains people who respond.",
        "Verse 8 assumes the audience has already believed, linking the washing to their faith response.",
        "Paul is contrasting works-righteousness with mercy, not faith with divine grace.",
