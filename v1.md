# Open Invitation Change Requests

1) Extra Scripture Context

Each passage, especially the ones where we need to carefully analyze the context, needs some extra context on the scripture detail/study page.  I'd like a toggle that displays the verses before/after the verse(s) being studied.  At least 5 verses, but for some of the more delicate verses we may need more - use your discretion.  Initially hide the extra context unless the user wants to turn it on.  Have a nice animation when it's displayed/hidden.

2) Back button vs Links

Using the back button gives a nice experience - if i've got one of the scripture tiles in my scroll view and i click into it, the use the browser back button, i am put back to the same scroll area of the first page.  if i click "Back to all passages" however, i lose my place.  Is it possible to have the link also put me back in the right scroll view?

3) Scripture Spotlights - concise view 

The scripture spotlights take up a lot of vertical room with the scripture description, then the scripture itself, along with all the badges and links and titles.  Let's add feature toggles in a js file, so we can keep some functionality if we want to switch back and forth between them.  Our first feature toggle will be "concise spotlights".  Turn it on initially.  When it's on, instead of the scripture description being in the tile, just have the scripture itself.  When the user hovers over the tile (anywhere on the tile) a tooltip of sorts should be displayed - centered and vertically bottom on the page (with a little margin) - displaying the description.  The idea is the user would hover over a tile and the description would appear at the bottom, almost like closed captions.  animate showing the text if possible.
